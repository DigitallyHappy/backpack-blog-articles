# Backpack Blog Articles

This repository should hold drafts for [BackpackForLaravel.com](https://backpackforlaravel.com) articles, and allow people to receive feedback and collaborate on them. **If you have an idea for a good blog post, please submit an issue. If your idea gets approved, you can submit a PR with the article.**

_Note: This repository is hosted within the DigitallyHappy organisation because it's intended to become _private_, and we can't do that in the Backpack organisation, because it has too many members. Private repositories in the Backpack organisation would cost thousands of dollars every month._

# Authors

### Paid Authors

**We're experimenting with the idea of paying authors for important blog posts.** This would provide:
- the author 
  - _some_ money for his work (somewhere around $100 per article)
  - recognition (author is clearly stated)
  - link back to his website or project (within the blog post, or in signature)
  - promotion within our community and marketing channels;
  - ownership of the content, as long as he uses the Backpack blog link as the primary source (he could even publish on Medium, as long as the canonical URL is the one from the Backpack blog);
- Backpack developers 
  - simple tutorials for the biggest pain points they have

To see what articles we deem important enough to pay for them, please check out the issues section on this repository.

### Non Paid Authors

All non-paid authors would have the same benefits as paid authors, except for the actual payment. If the subject is not someting we consider super-important, we could still publish your article. Submit an issue and we'll let you know. But. We reserve the right to restrict what content ends up on our blog. We want the blog to be _very_ high quality, so only high-quality posts will be published.
