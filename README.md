# Backpack Blog Articles

This repository should hold drafts for [BackpackForLaravel.com](https://backpackforlaravel.com) articles, and allow people to receive feedback and collaborate on them. **If you have an idea for a good blog post, please submit an issue. If your idea gets approved, you can submit a PR with the article.**

---

# Authors

**We're experimenting with guest posting on backpackforlaravel.com.** This would provide:
- the author 
  - recognition (author is clearly stated)
  - link back to his website or project (within the blog post, or in signature)
  - promotion within our community and marketing channels;
  - ownership of the content, as long as he uses the Backpack blog link as the primary source (he could even publish on Medium, as long as the canonical URL is the one from the Backpack blog);
- Backpack developers 
  - simple tutorials for the biggest pain points they have

To see what articles we think are a priority, please check out the issues section on this repository.
